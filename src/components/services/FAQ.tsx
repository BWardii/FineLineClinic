      question: 'How long do the results typically last?',
      answer: 'Results vary depending on the treatment. Botox typically lasts 3-4 months, dermal fillers can last 6-18 months, and vitamin infusions provide immediate benefits that can last several weeks. During your consultation, we\'ll discuss expected duration for your specific treatment plan.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are the treatments painful?',
      answer: 'Most of our treatments involve minimal discomfort. We use topical numbing creams and the finest needles available to ensure your comfort. Many clients describe the sensation as a small pinch. For vitamin infusions, you\'ll feel a slight pinch when the IV is inserted, then just relaxation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I expect during recovery?',
      answer: 'Recovery varies by treatment. Injectable treatments may cause minor swelling or bruising that resolves within a few days. Vitamin infusions have no downtime. We provide detailed aftercare instructions and are always available to answer questions during your recovery.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know which treatment is right for me?',
      answer: 'During your consultation, Dr. Ayaan will assess your skin, discuss your goals, and recommend the best treatment plan for you. We consider your lifestyle, budget, and desired outcomes to create a personalised approach that delivers natural-looking results.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are the treatments safe?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. We only use FDA-approved products and follow strict safety protocols. Dr. Ayaan is board-certified and has performed thousands of procedures. We conduct thorough medical histories and discuss any potential risks during your consultation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I combine multiple treatments?',
      answer: 'Yes! Many clients benefit from combination treatments. For example, Botox and dermal fillers work beautifully together, and vitamin infusions complement any aesthetic treatment. We\'ll create a comprehensive plan that addresses all your concerns safely and effectively.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I\'m not satisfied with my results?',
      answer: 'Your satisfaction is our priority. We offer complimentary follow-up appointments and will work with you to achieve your desired results. In the rare case that you\'re not satisfied, we\'ll discuss options to address your concerns at no additional cost.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How far in advance should I book my appointment?',
      answer: 'We recommend booking 1-2 weeks in advance for regular appointments. For special events, book 2-4 weeks ahead to allow time for any potential touch-ups. Emergency appointments may be available - please call us to discuss your needs.',
    },
