      question: 'How long do Botox results last?',
      answer: 'Botox results typically last 3-4 months. The duration can vary depending on individual factors such as metabolism, muscle strength, and lifestyle. Regular treatments can help maintain optimal results, and some clients find that results last longer with consistent treatment over time.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are dermal fillers safe?',
      answer: 'Yes, when administered by qualified practitioners, dermal fillers are very safe. We use only FDA-approved hyaluronic acid fillers from reputable manufacturers. Side effects are typically mild and temporary, including slight swelling or bruising at injection sites. We conduct thorough consultations to ensure suitability for treatment.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between microneedling with polynucleotides and mesotherapy?',
      answer: 'Both treatments use microneedling to deliver active ingredients, but they differ in the substances used. Polynucleotides are DNA fragments that promote tissue regeneration and healing, ideal for anti-aging and skin quality improvement. Mesotherapy uses customised vitamin and nutrient cocktails for hydration and rejuvenation. Your practitioner will recommend the best option based on your skin concerns.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How soon will I see results from aesthetic treatments?',
      answer: 'Results vary by treatment: Botox shows effects in 3-7 days with full results at 2 weeks. Dermal fillers provide immediate volume with final results after swelling subsides (1-2 weeks). Microneedling treatments show gradual improvement over 4-6 weeks as collagen production increases. Polynucleotide and Profhilo treatments show progressive results over 4-8 weeks.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there any downtime after aesthetic treatments?',
      answer: 'Most aesthetic treatments have minimal downtime. Botox and fillers may cause slight swelling or bruising for 1-3 days. Microneedling treatments may result in mild redness for 24-48 hours. We provide detailed aftercare instructions to minimise any side effects and optimise healing. Most clients return to normal activities immediately or within a day.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know which treatment is right for me?',
      answer: 'During your complimentary consultation, we assess your skin condition, discuss your aesthetic goals, and review your medical history. Our experienced practitioners will recommend the most suitable treatments based on your individual needs, skin type, and desired outcomes. We believe in a personalised approach to achieve natural-looking results.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I combine different aesthetic treatments?',
      answer: 'Yes, many treatments can be combined for enhanced results. Popular combinations include Botox with dermal fillers for comprehensive facial rejuvenation, or microneedling with polynucleotides for optimal skin regeneration. We create customised treatment plans that may include multiple procedures, properly spaced for safety and effectiveness.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I do to prepare for my treatment?',
      answer: 'Preparation varies by treatment but generally includes avoiding blood-thinning medications and supplements (aspirin, fish oil) for 1 week prior, avoiding alcohol 24 hours before, and arriving with clean skin. For microneedling treatments, avoid retinoids and exfoliating products for 3-5 days beforehand. Detailed pre-treatment instructions are provided during your consultation.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are aesthetic treatments painful?',
      answer: 'Most treatments involve minimal discomfort. We use fine needles and topical anaesthetics when appropriate. Botox injections feel like small pinpricks, dermal fillers may cause slight pressure, and microneedling treatments use numbing cream for comfort. Our practitioners are skilled in techniques to minimise discomfort while ensuring effective treatment delivery.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much do aesthetic treatments cost?',
      answer: 'Costs vary depending on the treatment type, area treated, and amount of product required. Botox starts from £135, dermal fillers from £250, and microneedling treatments from £150. We provide detailed pricing during your consultation and offer package deals for multiple treatments.'
